          <li>The <b>script</b> element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>

          <li>In <b>semantic HTML elements</b>, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage. (Ex. body element)</li>
          <li>An example of <b>non-semantic elements</b> are the div element and span element.</li>
          <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an <b>opening tag</b> and a <b>closing tag</b>.</li>
          <li>An <b>element</b> refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>The <b>h1</b>, <b>h2</b>, <b>h3</b>, (and so on) elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable or <b>var</b> is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li><b>Control flow</b> is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>A <b>string</b> is a sequence of one or more characters that may consist of letters, numbers, or symbols.</li>
          <li>A <b>console.log</b> method is used to output a message to the web console by adding an argument.</li>
          <li>The word <b>console</b> refers to a test environment that developers use to check out their code.</li>
          <li><b>.log()</b> is a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer and will output whatever we add inside the parentheses to the console.</li>
          <li>An <b>if</b> statement is a way of introducing decision-making into the code. The code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator, or <b>===</b> checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result 'true' if the values are equal and 'false' if the values are not equal.</li>
          <li>An <b>array</b> is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
          <li>An <b>index</b> is the location number of the data item in the array.</li>
          <li>A <b>for</b> loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>A <b>for</b> loop contains a starting point, condition, and a statement that allows the array to iterate over each item.</li>
          <li>A <b>function</b> is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>There are two requirements for a function; define the function and then call the function.</li>
          <li><b>Math.floor()</b> and <b>Math.random()</b> are both properties of JavaScript's built-in Math object that can be used together to generate a random number.</li>
